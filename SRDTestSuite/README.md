		- Firefox web browser (www.mozilla.org) v >= 24
		- Chrome web browser (www.google.com/chrome/â€Ž) v >= 29

	Installing Chrome Driver:

		Download the appropriate file: Chrome Driver (http://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/downloads/list)

		And unzip the Chrome Driver in /usr/bin/google-chrome folder.


Structure:

	The SRD Test Suite is divided in different modules:

	- Light test suite with basic tests; 
	- Test suite of the Search/Download tab;
	- Test suite to check all the download links of SRD;
	- Test suite of the User Interface; 
	- Regression tests to test the SRD for changes.


Running tests: 

 	Configuring the base URL:

		The base URL to execute the tests can be modified in the srd_selenium_tests.conf file. It just need the base url between quotes (e.g. BASE_URL = "http://samate.nist.gov/SRD").

	
	To execute all tests: 

		$python run_srd_tests.py

		Explanation:

			This command executes all tests cases in the suite. It takes around 8 hours to finish the execution. 


	To execute the User Interface tests: 

		$python run_srd_tests.py ui

		Explanation:

			[ui] => argument to execute the User Interface tests. 
			For more information about these tests check the file srd_ui_tcs/srd_ui_tcs_description.md.


	To execute the Search/Download tests: 

		$python run_srd_tests.py sd

		Explanation:

			[sd] => argument to execute the Search/Download tab tests. 
			For more information about these tests check the file srd_ui_tcs/srd_sd_tcs_description.md.


	To check the download links of SRD: 

		$python run_srd_tests.py ck

		Explanation:

			[ck] => argument to check all the download links in SRD. 
			For more information about these tests check the file srd_ui_tcs/srd_ck_tcs_description.md.


	To execute the light version of tests: 

		$python run_srd_tests.py lt

		Explanation:
		
			[lt] => argument to execute basic tests to check the most important functionalities.
			For more information about these tests check the file srd_lt_tcs/srd_ck_tcs_description.md.


	To execute the Regression Tests:

	[For more information about Regression Tests check the file regression_tests/ReadMe.txt]
		
		RunAll.php:

			$python run_srd_tests.py rg RunAll.php -g

			Explanation:
				[-g] => Generate snapshot (Expected Directory)
				
				After make changes to website or database you can run "RunAll.php" without -g to run diff [$python run_srd_tests.py rg RunAll.php] and examine changes.


		TraditionalTesting.php:

			$python run_srd_tests.py rg TraditionalTesting.php [-g] [-u] anyValidBaseUrl *.xml

			Explanation:
				[-g] (Optional) => Generate snapshot (Expected Directory)
				[-u] (Optional) => Base URL Override - Must be followed by valid base url (anyValidBaseUrl)
				*.xml 			=> Listing of XML files of valid testcase structure
		

		DownloadTesting.php:

			$python run_srd_tests.py rg DownloadTesting.php [-u] [anyValidBase Url] [*.xml files directory]

			Explanation:
				[-u] (Optional) => Base URL Override - Must be followed by valid base url (anyValidBaseUrl)
				*.xml 			=> Listing of XML files of valid testcase structure
